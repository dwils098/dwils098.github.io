On this page you will be able to access all the resources and material used in the Labs and Tutorials.

The content will be divided by day rather than sessions (Lab/Tut), and any update or additional material will be posted here as well.

##Session 1 (September 11th 2014)
###Tutorial:
<a href="/public/CSI_2772/Lab_1/CSI2772_Lab_1.pptx">PowerPoint</a> presentation.

<a href="/public/CSI_2772/Lab_1/">Directory</a> containing the code snippets for this session.

###Additional Info:
Here are questions to which, the answers weren't clear, and needed more explanations.

* Usage and exemple of the keyword `extern` (taken from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10422050/1201965)):
  1. `extern` comes in useful when you have global variables. You declare the existence of global variables in a header file, so that each source file that includes the header file knows about it.
  2. The global variable declared in the header file only need to be “defined” once in one of your source files.
  3. See example [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10422050/1201965).


* Clarification as to how **Automatic Type Conversion** is done (taken from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5563063/1201965)):
* Linkage error that occurred frequently during the first lab, can be corrected by using `qmake`:
  * `qmake` is a utility that simplifies the building process of projects across multiple platforms.
  * It utilize a `.pro` file (which is a project file), and generates the Makefiles.
  * It can be used with other IDE, i.e.: Not a Qt exclusive.
  * For more information see [this](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-manual.html).
