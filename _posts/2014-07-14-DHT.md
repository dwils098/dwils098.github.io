title: Exploration of Distributed Hash Algorithms and Overlay Networks
---
This post will simply serve as a central repository of my findings, thoughts and ideas about the subject of DHT in the context of Overlay Networks. More specifically, my exploration has for purpose to find the most suitable candidate to implement a Peer-to-peer architecture. Without further ado, let's start with some basic definition and try to understand a bit more what these algorithms are meant for, but also how can they apply to the problem at hand.

#Overlay Networks
What is an [Overlay Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network)? As defined in the Wikipedia article: *[...] (It) is a computer network which is built on top of another network [...]* The network on top of which the overlay network is built, can be, in general, thought as a physical network with physical connections. Therefore, the overlay network represent the logical (or virtual) connection between each nodes, and this enables to represent the physical path between two nodes, in terms of the logical connection or relation. As an example, if **Node A** is indirectly connected to **Node B** in the physical network architecture:

(A --> C --> D --> B)

In the overlay network the same connection can be expressed as:

(A --> B)

Thus it simplifies and abstracts the physical characteristics of the underlying network structure. One the Overlay Network protocols, based on TCP/IP is Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).

#Distributed Hash Tables
Distributed Hash Tables originated from the boom of p2p applications for file sharing and content delivery. The requirements that rose from this phenomena were the following: a need for an autonomous and decentralized system where the participating nodes forms the system; enhanced reliability of said system even in the presence of nodes continuously joining, leaving and/or failing; and the need for high scalability in the presence of thousands and millions of nodes.

DHTs can be described as a decentralized distributed system providing lookup services, in a manner similar to a hash table using key-value pairs. The responsibility of maintaining the mappings is evenly distributed among the nodes composing the system. As a direct consequence there is no single point of failure and this leads to a highly-dynamic distributed system.

##Typical Structure
The structure of a typical DHT can be seen as an aggregation of these three components: the Keyspace, the Keyspace Partitioning Scheme, and the Overlay Network.

###Keyspace and its Partitioning Scheme
The most basic element of the DHT is the Keyspace, which can be represented as being a set of n-bit strings (i.e.: 256-bit strings `Keyspace = 2^256`)
