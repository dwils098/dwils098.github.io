Based off the Chord implementation of DHT and the De Bruijn graph, Koorde is a variation of this DHT that let's the user trade maintenance overhead against hop count in the range of `O(log n)` to `O(log n / log log n)`.

Let's go back to basics and introduce what is a De Bruijn graph...

##De Bruijn Graph
This type of graph originated from the Dutch mathematician [Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn), hence it bears his name. 

*They consist of a n-dimensional directed graph of m-symbols, which represents the overlaps between the sequence of symbols.*

The set of vertices is constructed by enumerating all the possible sequences of length `n` using the `m` symbols, and each sequence in the set is unique.

Thus if `S := {1,0}` then `m = 2`, consequently if `n = 3` then `V = S^3 = {(111),(110),(101),(100),(011),(010),(001),(000)}`

The set of edges is constructed in the following manner: *If a vertex A can be expressed as vertex B by shifting all its symbols by one place to the **left** and then adding a new symbol at the end of this vertex, then a directed edge from B to A is added to the set of edges.*

In this example: there exist an directed edge from `(111) to (110)` with label `0` and the edge set looks something like this:

`E = {(111,110; 0), (111,111; 1), (110, 100; 0), (110, 101; 1) ... (000, 000; 0), (000, 001; 1)}`

One possible graphical representation of this graph is:

###Interesting Properties
Here's a quick list of the interesting properties of this type of graph, as stated [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph#Properties):

1. Each vertex has exactly `m` incoming and `m` outgoing edges.
2. De Bruijn graphs are also Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs. More specifically the Euler cycles and Hamiltonian cycles are De Bruijn sequences.

##Koorde
Now that we know a little bit more about De Bruijn graphs, how exactly do they apply to the Koorde DHT?

For demonstration purposes, node IDs are represented by binary numbers, thus `m = 2` in this case. Thus each node has exactly 2 outgoing edges, which can be written in the following form:

1. Node x has an edge to Node `2m mod 2^b`; where `n = 2^b` in a n-dimensional De Bruijn graph.
2. Node x has an edge to Node `2m + 1 mod 2^b`; where `n = 2^b` in a n-dimensional De Bruijn graph.

As a direct consequence of this, each node also has only two incoming edges. Thus it is easy to observe that any key can be located by contacting `O(log n)` nodes.
