Based off the Chord implementation of DHT and the De Bruijn graph, Koorde is a variation of this DHT that let's the user trade maintenance overhead against hop count in the range of `O(log n)` to `O(log n / log log n)`.

Let's go back to basics and introduce what is a De Bruijn graph...

##De Bruijn Graph
This type of graph originated from the Dutch mathematician [Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn), hence it bears his name. 

*They consist of a n-dimensional directed graph of m-symbols, which represents the overlaps between the sequence of symbols.*

The set of vertices is constructed by enumerating all the possible sequences of length `n` using the `m` symbols, and each sequence in the set is unique.

Thus if `S := {1,0}` then `m = 2`, consequently if `n = 3` then `V = S^3 = {(111),(110),(101),(100),(011),(010),(001),(000)}`

The set of edges is constructed in the following manner: *If a vertex A can be expressed as vertex B by shifting all its symbols by one place to the **left** and then adding a new symbol at the end of this vertex, then a directed edge from B to A is added to the set of edges.*

In this example: there exist an directed edge from `(111) to (110)` with label `0` and the edge set looks something like this:

`E = {(111,110; 0), (111,111; 1), (110, 100; 0), (110, 101; 1) ... (000, 000; 0), (000, 001; 1)}`

One possible graphical representation of this graph is:

###Interesting Properties
Here's a quick list of the interesting properties of this type of graph, as stated [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph#Properties):

1. Each vertex has exactly `m` incoming and `m` outgoing edges.
2. De Bruijn graphs are also Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs. More specifically the Euler cycles and Hamiltonian cycles are De Bruijn sequences.

##Koorde
Now that we know a little bit more about De Bruijn graphs, how exactly do they apply to the Koorde DHT?

For demonstration purposes, node IDs are represented by binary numbers, thus `m = 2` in this case. Thus each node has exactly 2 outgoing edges, which can be written in the following form:

1. Node x has an edge to Node `2m mod 2^b`; where `n = 2^b` in a n-dimensional De Bruijn graph.
2. Node x has an edge to Node `2m + 1 mod 2^b`; where `n = 2^b` in a n-dimensional De Bruijn graph.

As a direct consequence of this, each node also has only two incoming edges. Thus it is easy to observe that any key can be located by contacting `O(log n)` nodes.

One observation is obvious, this implies that the graph is completely connected, although this is not the case in real-life p2p systems. Thus, the authors devised another strategy to overcome this.

###Routing
In presence of a sparsely populated identifier ring, which is a reality in terms of p2p systems, the Koorde DHT will simulate the nodes missing from the ring. It uses a technique, which consist for a node of keeping a pointer to the first node `d` that precedes `2m` (or the first De Bruijn node in the ring) and the successor of `d`; and finally a pointer to its successor on the ring. This ensures that if we do a lookup the expected routing cost will be `2b`. *For a complete proof and explanation on this routing method please see this [paper](http://iptps03.cs.berkeley.edu/final-papers/koorde.ps) section 3.2.*

The authors also proposes improvement on this routing scheme, since the node that originates the query, `Node m`, is responsible for all the imaginary nodes between itself and its successor, it is possible to simulate the start the query at any of the imaginary nodes in this interval to no cost. 

If the identifier ring is really sparse, only the top bits of the imaginary nodes are important, and thus by making the bottom bits of that imaginary node equal to the top bits of the key (that we are querying for) we can achieve a lookup in the order of `O(log n)` hops. Because as soon as the top bits of that imaginary nodes are shifted out, then the lookup algorithm will have reach the node responsible for the key. *For a complete proof and explanation on this routing method improvement please see this [paper](http://iptps03.cs.berkeley.edu/final-papers/koorde.ps) section 3.3.*

This will conclude the exploration section of this DHT, next post will be concerned with Pastry.
