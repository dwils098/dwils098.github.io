The second post in this exploration series is concerned with one of the most popular DHT, namely Chord. It was part of the 4 original DHT protocols proposed, alongside [CAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_addressable_network), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry_(DHT)">Tapestry</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry_(DHT)">Pastry</a>. More precisely, Chord specifies how to assign keys to nodes and also how to access the keys by locating the nodes coordinating those keys.

This lookup protocol uses consistent hashing to generate the keys and IDs, namely it uses the SHA-1 algorithm to do the hashing.

The topology consist of arranging the node keys in a circle that has at most `2^m` nodes, which contains a range of keys varying from `0 - 2^(m-1)`.

A node in this protocol has the following: 

1. **Successor**: is the next node in the identifier circle (in a clockwise direction).
2. **Predecessor**: is the next node in the identifier circle (in a counter-clockwise direction).

Each node is responsible of a segment of the identifier circle next to it. This segment can represent the `l` nodes preceding that node, and the `l` nodes succeeding that node. This ensure that nodes are able to locate successors and predecessors of themselves and other nodes (co-operatively), even when multiple failures occurs or multiple joining and leaving of participating nodes.

Keys and nodes are assigned an m-bit identifier, for nodes this corresponds to `hash(IP_ADDRESS)` and for keys this generally translates to `hash(KEYWORD)`. The nodes proceed to the creation of a logical ring of `2^m` positions, which are numbered from 0 to `2^m - 1`.

For example, key `k` is assigned to node `successor(k)`, which corresponds to the node whose identifier is equal to or follows the identifier of `k`. 

Each nodes are responsible for roughly `K / N` keys, where `K` is the number of keys and `N` is the number of nodes.

Each node keeps a table called "a finger table", that contains up to `m` entries; where the `ith` entry of node `n` will contain the address of successor `(n + 2^(i-1) mod 2^m)`. By using these "finger tables", this ensure that the number of hops (or nodes contacted) in an N-node network, to find a key is `O(log N)`.

###From Original Paper
The authors of the [original paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383071) related to Chord, present their idea as being a distributed lookup protocol that support only one operation: *given a key, it maps the key onto a node.*

The fact of using consistent hashing is justified because it enables a balanced repartition of the keys throughout the different nodes. This reduce the amount of re-structuring and overhead when a node leaves or join the system.

One important aspect of Chord relates to its deterministic behavior, either a key is found or it is not. In the latter case, it is definitively not in the system. All of this is done in a predictable amount of time.

####P2P Problems addressed by Chord
The authors claims that Chord addresses the following problems relating to the design and/or the technical difficulties inherent to distributed peer-to-peer systems:

1. **Load Balancing**: Keys are spread evenly among the nodes, since Chord really boils down to being a distributed hash function.
2. **Decentralization**: All nodes are homogeneous in their functionality and importance to the system.
3. **Scalability**: Scalability is achieve by design in Chord, thus the cost of a lookup is proportional to the log of the number of nodes.
4. **Availability**: Chord automatically maintain it's routing tables (finger tables), thus a node can always be found even in a highly dynamic system.
5. **Flexible Naming**: There exist no constraints on the structure of keys.

This will conclude the exploration section of this DHT, next post will be concerned with a modified version of Chord, namely Koorde.
