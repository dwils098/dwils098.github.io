In this post we will explore Pastry, a scalable distributed object location and routing substrate for wide-area peer-to-peer applications. It will mainly based upon this [publication](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/antr/PAST/pastry.pdf).

Here's a very brief explanation of Pastry (taken directly from the original publication): *A Pastry system is a self-organizing overlay network of nodes, where each node routes client requests and interacts with local instances of one or more applications.*

##Nodes
Each node in a Pastry system is randomly assigned a unique identifier (nodeId) of 128 bits, which it corresponds to its position on the identifier ring. Hashing of the node's public key or IP address is common to generate the nodeId, generally this is accomplish by a cryptographic hash function.

In this DHT, the nodes possesses three tables: the Leaf set, the Routing table and the Neighborhood set. Let's have a quick overview on the purpose and compositions of these tables.

###Routing Table
The Routing table is organized into `ceiling(log 2^b N)` rows with `2^b - 1` entries each. The entries are organized following this prefix based rule:

The `2^b - 1` entries at row `n` refers to a node whose nodeId share's the present node's nodeId `n` first digits, but whose `n + 1th` digit is not the present nodeId's `n + 1th` digit, but rather any of the other `2^b - 1` digits.

In the event that it is impossible to find a node with a suitable nodeId, the corresponding entry in the Routing table is left empty. Also, from a practical point of view IP addresses can be included in the cell of the Routing table to facilitate the access to the node.

**N.B.:** `N` corresponds to the total number of nodes in the network; `2^b` corresponds to the base in which the digits are represented. The choice of `b` enables a configuration of the trade-off between the size of the populated portion of the Routing table and the maximum number of hops required to route between any pair of nodes.

###Neighborhood Set
The Neighborhood set contains the nodeId and IP addresses of the `M` nodes that are closest to the local node (according to a proximity metric). It serves the purpose of preserving the locality properties of the system rather that serving routing purposes.

###Leaf Set
The Leaf set, of size `L`, corresponds to the `L/2` numerically closest larger nodeIds as well as the `L/2` numerically closest smallest nodeIds relative to the current node nodeId. It is used during the message routing activities.

##Routing Protocol
In a network composed of `N` node, using Pastry it is possible to route to the (numerically) closest node to a given key with a time complexity of `O(ceiling(log 2^b N))` and eventual delivery is guaranteed unless `floor(L/2)` nodes with adjacent ids fails at the same exact moment.

It routes messages to the node for which its id is numerically closest to the given key. Under normal circumstances, a node forwards the message to the node which nodeId shares a prefix with the key, which is at least one bit longer than the prefix shared from the current node and the key. If no other nodes can be found with this characteristic, the it is forwarded to a node that shares a prefix of same length as the current node with the key, and that is (numerically) closer to the key (than the current node).

It can be summarized as the following:

1. Given a message, the node checks to see if the key is within the range of nodeIds covered by its Leaf set.
    
	i. If it's the case, forwards it directly to the corresponding node.
	
	ii. If not, use the Routing table to find the node that shares a common prefix with the key by at least one more digit that then current node and forward the message.

2. In the event that no such node is present in the Routing table, forward the message to the node that shares a common prefix with the key (of equal length than the prefix shared with the current node) and that is (numerically) closer to the key (than the current node).

3. Delivery is then guaranteed, since such a node must be in the Leaf set unless the message is already at the node with the (numerically) closest nodeId, and unless `L/2` adjacent nodes in the leaf set failed simultaneously, then one node must be live.

###Performance
As stated above, this protocol provides a routing performance, assuming correct and up to date tables without recent node failures, of `ceiling(log 2^b N)` steps.

##Characteristics
Let's finish this exploration with some of the differentiating characteristics of Pastry.

1. The locality component that is integrated as an core functionality of the routing protocol (a.k.a. locality-aware routing).
2. Self-organizing overlay network structure.

The next post in this exploration series will be concerned with Kademlia.
