title: ZeroMQ A first impression
---

As an exploration exercise, I wished to utilize a [Publish-Subscribe Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) within my BBB Development cluster in order to provide asynchronous messaging capabilities. Thus after a bit of research on the Inter-Webs, I settled on using [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) which seemed the most flexible and lightweight message queue framework currently available.
